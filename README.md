DCAM-DNet: Densely Connected Attention based  Deep Network using Network Deconvolution for  crop-disease recognition system


This model shows good model generalizability using its dense connections. To address the issue of duplicate correlations in convolution  operations, the suggested DCAM-DNet uses Network Deconvolution instead of convolution operation. In comparison to  earlier evaluated systems, the proposed DCAM-DNet recognizer yields better accurate results in most situations on five  different crop disease datasets.
